## Summary:

This is a queue simulator based on stochastic time events.
The aim is to simulate a real queue, like a queue at the post office,
where users arrive in a random order. When a client arrives, s/he is
the last one who will be served. Therefore, this is a FIFO (First In First Out) queue.

For each client there are two stochastic events: arrival and service times. 
In this simulation, the arrival time is sampled from an exponential distribution, 
whereas the service time from a triangular distribution.

This simulation shows when a person arrives, is ready to be served, and finally leaves.    


## About stochastic variables:
To simulate a continuous stochastic variable, we use the reversed transformation method. 
In more detail, let X be a continuous stochastic variable, so X ~ f(x), where f(x) is its 
density function. Let F(x) be its distribution function. Let f(x) be a increase monotonous 
function, so F(x) is invertible. We can demonstrate that
```
U = F(X)
```
where U is the uniform stochastic variable (for a proof, see "A first course in probability" by Ross). 
U is exactly F(X) iff X is x, so where
```
U = F(X = x).
```
Therefore, we obtain a stochastic history for the uniform stochastic variable.
As we are interested in the stochastic history for the stochastic variable X,
we must calculate the reverse function:
```
X = F[-1](U)    (where F[-1] is the reverse function of F).
```

Simqueue samples clients arrival times from an extponential distribution, whereas 
service times are sampled from a triangular distribution. 

### Exponential variable
Let X ~ Eb be an exponential stochastic variable of parameter b.
Its density function is:
```
f(x) =  b*e exp(-b*x)   if x >= 0
    	0		if x < 0
```	    
Its distribution function is:
```
y = F(z) = INTEGRAL( f(z) dz )  from 0 to z
	 = 1 - e exp(-b*z)
```
(y is an uniform variable U !!)
The reverse function of F(z) is:
```
z = F[-1](y) = -( ln(1-y) / b )
```
As a random variable `rand` is computed from a uniform stochastic variable 
in every programming language, we can write
```
z = -( ln(1 - rand()) / b )
```

### Triangular variable
As above, we can obtain a stochastic history for the triangular stochastic variable.	




## Example:

Notes:

1. Time is expressed in minutes in this model.
2. When a client leaves the service (Leaving Time) another is served.
3. Client arrival time is sampled from an exponential distribution.
4. Client actual service time is sampled from a triangular distribution.
