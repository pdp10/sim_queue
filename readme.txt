Object:
	This is a simulator based on casual temporary cadences.
	Here, I want to simulate a real queue, like a queue of a post office,
	where users arrive in a casual order.  When a client arrives, he is
	the last one who will be served. (FIFO = First In First Out). In particular
	there are two stochastic facts:
	      1) the time of arrive of a client,
	      2) the time of a client service.
	During the time some clients arrive and some others go away.
	A simulation of this reality is to show when a person arrives, starts to be
	served and then leaves the server.    


	

About stochastic varibles:
      1) Exponential casual variable;
      2) Triangular casual variable;
      To simulate a continuous stochastic variable, we use the reversed transformation method. 
      On details, let be X a continuous stochastic variable, so X ~ f(x), where f(x) is its 
      density function. Let be F(x) its distribution function. Let it be a increase monotonous 
      function, so F(x) is invertible.
      We can demonstrate (see "A first course in probability" by Ross for the demonstration) that
	    U = F(X)
      where U is the uniform stochastic variable. U is exactly F(X) iff X is x, so where
	    U = F(X = x).
      In this way, we obtain a casual history for the uniform stochastic variable.
      Because we are interested in the casual history for the stochastic variable X,
      we must calculate the reverse function:
	    X = F[-1](U)    (where F[-1] is the reverse function of F).
      
      P.E. 
	   1)   Let be X ~ Eb an exponential stochastic variable of parameter b.
		Its density function is:
		    f(x) =  b*e exp(-b*x)   if x >= 0
			    0		    if x < 0
		Its distribution function is:
		    y = F(z) = INTEGRAL( f(z) dz )  from 0 to z
			     = 1 - e exp(-b*z)
		    (y is an uniform variable U !!!)
		The reverse function of F(z) is:
		    z = F[-1](y) = -( ln(1-y) / b )
		
		But a random variable rand, computated from every programming language,
		is a simulated uniform stochastic variable, so we can write
		    z = -( ln(1 - rand()) / b )

	   2)	As (1) we can obtain a casual history for the triangular stochastic variable.

Notes:
  1) In this model, the time is expressed in minutes.
  2) When a user leaves the service (Go Away) another is served.
  3) An exponential stochastic variable for input time:
     	When I ask you the averange number of users per hour, the program convert this number (user/hour) in the 
    	averange number of users per minute (user/minute). Also, it gives you the averange time of arrive of a new 
	user (a). This helps you to examine that (a) is the expected value for the first column:
		where T  is the actual time,
			n  is the capacity of the queue,
			t(k) is the time function that returns the time distance from the user_k to the user_(k-1), 
			so tk = T - t(k-1) ,
		we obtain
			(a)  =  [SUM ( t(k) ) for k = 1 to n ] / n      for n --> infinite (the low of the great numbers)
  4) A triangular stochastic variable for input time:
     	"The maximum service time" is a misure of the maximum time registered for a service.
     	Infact this is the b parameter for the triangular casual variable T(a,m,b), where (a,b) is the interval in 
     	which there is the function of density for the variable and m is the mode ("the most common (the mode) 
     	service time"). The interval (a, b) is (0, b) because at least no client is served (so a is 0). The 
     	mode m is the greatest value assumed by the density function of the triangular stochastic variable.
	As in the previous note, the averange service time (b) follows the same rule as for (a).
	Let be the user [24]:	
		x[24] = 69.80473426491487 ,                 
		y[24] = 150.0365004617665 ,                
		z[24] = 160.93758814506594 .
	The service time is the value ( 160.93758814506594 - 150.0365004617665 ), so: 
			st[24] = z[24] - y[24].
	You can also observe that 
		the mode for the vector st is for the mode you have put at start for n --> infinite,
		the expected value for the vector st is for the averange service time for n --> infinite,
		no st[k] for k = 1 to n is over than the maximum service time.
